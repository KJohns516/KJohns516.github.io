In 2014, I was fresh out of high school and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Originally, I chose Computer Science and for a while I liked it, but my subconscious started to unravel self-doubts within myself. “Was this degree right for me?” “What if I don’t like it later on?” “Will I be happy?” So I started jumping from major to major receiving little to no progress within my degree plan. I let years go by only to feel disappointed. Also life gets in the way and you become succumb within treacherous endeavors. 
 	
	However, I wasn’t going to let that stop me. I took one semester to really figure out what I wanted to and what would make me happy in the long run. I looked through all the degree options and only to come around my first choice. I fell back into my Computer Science degree plan and currently still working on it. Continuing my studies was good, receiving my first job within Network Operations was great, but I needed more I wanted to submerge myself more into what I wanted to do. Software development and the idea of building applications has always fascinated me. 
	
	The idea of being able to open up an application and start creating your own puzzle on whatever you desired was alluring. Also in the future I would like to look more into Web Design both capabilities would open many doors. However, for now I'll continue my studies within Flat Iron. Starting this program has really opened my eyes to the possibilities of coding as well as how fun it can be.
